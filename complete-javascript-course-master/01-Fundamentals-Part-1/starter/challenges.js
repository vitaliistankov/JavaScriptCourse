//Coding Challenge #1
/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall
*/

// 1
//const marksWeight = 78;
//const marksHeight = 1.69;

//const jhonsWeight = 92;
//const jhonsHeight = 1.95;

const marksWeight = 95;
const marksHeight = 1.88;

const jhonsWeight = 85;
const jhonsHeight = 1.76;


//2
//const marksBmi = marksWeight / marksHeight ** 2;
const marksBmi = marksWeight / (marksHeight * marksHeight);
//const jhonsBmi = jhonsWeight / jhonsHeight ** 2;
const jhonsBmi = marksWeight / (jhonsHeight * jhonsHeight);

//3

let markHigherBMI = marksBmi > jhonsBmi;

//console.log(marksBmi);
//console.log(jhonsBmi);
console.log(marksBmi, jhonsBmi, markHigherBMI);
//console.log(markHigherBMI);
