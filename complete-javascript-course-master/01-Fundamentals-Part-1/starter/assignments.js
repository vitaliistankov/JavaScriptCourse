//LECTURE: Values and Variables

/* 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and 
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console */

const country = "Bulgaria";
const continent = "Europe";
let population = 7;

console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);

//LECTURE: Data Types

/* 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the console */


// 1
const isIsland = false;
//let language;

// 2
console.log(isIsland);
console.log(population);
console.log(country);
//console.log(language);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//LECTURE: let, const and var

/* 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
    countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
    change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens */

//language = "Bulgarian";
//console.log(language);
const language = "Bulgarian";
console.log(language);
console.log(typeof language);

//LECTURE: Basic Operators
/*
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million 
people speak portuguese
